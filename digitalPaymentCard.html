                        solutions have become the backbone of commerce. Whether you're a solopreneur, a small business

                        Merchant services act as the bridge between your business and your customers’ wallets. They
                        enable you to accept payments via credit cards, debit cards, mobile wallets, and even
                        cryptocurrencies. But before you can get started, you need to set up a few things:
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="fs_18 fw_600 j_family ">Step 1: Get Your EIN (Employer Identification Number)</h2>
                    <p class="fs_16 fw_400 j_family tertiary-black lh_28 mt-1">
                        Think of your EIN as your business’s Social Security number. It’s a unique identifier from the
                        IRS that you’ll need to open a business bank account, file taxes, and, yes, sign up for merchant
                        services. Even if you're a solopreneur, having an EIN is critical to making your business look
                        professional and legitimate.
