                In the United States alone, over 2.5 million e-commerce stores operate actively, catering to the needs of a diverse consumer base. The numbers are staggering: U.S. consumers spent over $1 trillion on e-commerce in 2023, a figure that continues to grow as online shopping becomes increasingly ingrained in daily life. Globally, e-commerce sales are projected to account for over 22% of total retail sales by 2025, underscoring its rapid growth and dominance.
