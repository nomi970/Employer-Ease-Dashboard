            </h3>
            <p class="fs_16 fw_400 j_family lh_28 tertiary-black mt-2">
                In today’s digital world, businesses must find new ways to engage with customers, streamline operations,
                and enhance user experience. One of the most effective tools for achieving these goals is the Chatbot or
                AI Agent. But what exactly are these technologies, and why are they becoming essential for businesses of
                all sizes?

                    <ul class="mt-2">
                        <p class="fs_16 fw_400 j_family tertiary-black lh_28 mt-1">
                            A chatbot is a software program that simulates human conversation. It can respond to
                            customer inquiries, provide information, and guide users through tasks—all in real time.
                            Chatbots can be simple, using pre-set responses, or advanced, using Artificial Intelligence
                            (AI) to learn and improve over time.
                            Example: A chatbot on a website can greet visitors, answer common questions about services,
                            and help customers book appointments—all without human intervention.

                    <p class="fs_16 fw_400 j_family tertiary-black lh_28 mt-1">
                        An AI Agent is a more advanced version of a chatbot. It doesn’t just respond to questions—it can
                        analyze data, understand customer intent, and execute complex actions. AI agents are powered by
                        machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and automation tools.
                        Example: An AI Agent can analyze customer inquiries, identify patterns, and personalize
                        responses. If a customer repeatedly asks about a product, the AI Agent can suggest similar items
                        or offer discounts.
