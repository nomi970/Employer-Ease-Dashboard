                        Traditional banking primarily focused on basic services like deposits, withdrawals, and loans.
                        However, the evolution of digital banking has transformed how businesses interact with financial
                        institutions. Entrepreneurs now have access to banking platforms designed to:

                        Digital banking also eliminates much of the paperwork and delays of traditional banking,
